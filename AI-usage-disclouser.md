During the development of this project, I used AI tools as a supporting resource for learning, structuring documentation, and accelerating minor implementation tasks. Overall, AI assistance contributed approximately 30–40% of the project workflow, while the core logic, integration, and development decisions were implemented and executed by me.

How AI Was Used

AI was mainly utilized in the following areas:

Project Documentation & Planning:
I used AI prompting to help draft and structure the initial README.md file. The content and project explanation were based on my understanding and design, but AI helped in refining the wording and organizing the documentation in a professional format.

Learning & Feature Implementation Support:
AI was used as a learning assistant to understand how to implement external services such as SendGrid. After studying the concepts and workflow, I implemented the integration independently and ensured it worked correctly in my project.

Authentication Understanding:
AI was used to explore and understand the process of implementing Google Authentication. I used it to learn the setup and flow, and then applied the integration through my own implementation and testing.

Frontend UI Assistance:
AI was used occasionally for frontend improvements such as:

aligning UI components properly,

resolving styling/layout issues,

generating repetitive boilerplate code where required.

Debugging & Error Resolution:
AI was also used during debugging to help identify possible causes of errors, suggest fixes, and speed up troubleshooting. However, the final debugging decisions, testing, and resolution were done by me.

What Was Done Independently

All major development work such as system structure, feature logic, backend integration, frontend development, final implementation, and testing was completed independently by me. AI was used only as a productivity and learning aid, not as a replacement for development.
